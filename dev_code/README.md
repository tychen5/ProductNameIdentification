# Combined Output Generator

The Combined Output Generator is a Python script designed to merge multiple output files into a single, unified output file. It is great for handling large datasets or several data sources that need to be merged for further processing or analysis.

## Features
Efficiently handles large datasets and high volumes of data.
Supports various file formats such as CSV, JSON, and TXT.
Automatically detects and combines multiple output files.
Easy customization to suit specific requirements.
Dependencies

The script requires Python 3.x to run. No additional libraries or packages are needed.

## Usage

To use the script, place it in the same directory as the output files you wish to combine. The script will automatically detect and process the files, generating a single, unified output file.

## Customization

The script can be easily customized to suit specific requirements. For example, you can modify the file formats supported, the delimiter used in CSV files, or the output file name.

## Limitations

The script assumes that all input files have the same structure and format. If this is not the case, you may need to preprocess the files before using the script. Additionally, the script does not currently support merging files with different delimiters or file formats. This functionality can be added through customization.

### Future Improvements
Add support for merging files with different delimiters or file formats.
Implement a command-line interface for easier usage and customization.
Add error handling and logging for a better user experience.
Conclusion

The Combined Output Generator is a powerful and efficient tool for combining multiple output files into a single, unified file. With its easy customization and support for various file formats, it is an invaluable asset for data analysts and researchers working with large datasets or multiple data sources.
