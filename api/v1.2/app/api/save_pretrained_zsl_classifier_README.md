# Save Pretrained Zero-Shot Classification Model

This Python script, `save_pretrained_zsl_classifier.py`, is designed to save a pre-trained zero-shot classification model to a pickle file. The script is particularly useful when working with Docker containers, as it needs to be re-run every time the container changes CPU cores or switches between CPU and GPU usage.

### Dependencies

The script relies on the following Python libraries:

- `os`
- `pickle`
- `transformers`

Make sure to install the `transformers` library before running the script.

### Usage

1. Set the `data_path` variable to the path of your data directory where the pickle file will be saved.
2. Replace the placeholder `enter_your_pretrained_model_name_here` with the name of the pre-trained model you want to use for zero-shot classification.
3. Run the script to save the classifier object to a pickle file named `zslmodel.pkl` in the specified data directory.

### How it works

The script performs the following steps:

1. Imports the required libraries.
2. Defines the path to the data directory.
3. Initializes the zero-shot classification pipeline with a pre-trained model using the `transformers` library.
4. Saves the classifier object to a pickle file in the specified data directory.

By saving the pre-trained zero-shot classification model to a pickle file, you can easily load and use the model in other scripts or applications without having to re-initialize the pipeline every time.
