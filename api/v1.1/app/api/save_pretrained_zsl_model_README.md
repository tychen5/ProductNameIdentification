# Save Pretrained Zero-Shot Learning Model

This Python script, `save_pretrained_zsl_model.py`, is designed to save a pre-trained zero-shot classification model to a pickle file. This is particularly useful when working with Docker containers, as the script needs to be re-run every time the container changes CPU cores or switches between CPU and GPU usage.

### Dependencies

The script relies on the `transformers` library, which can be installed using the following command:

```
pip install transformers
```

### Usage

1. Set the `data_path` variable to the path of your desired data directory.
2. Replace the placeholder `enter_your_pretrained_model_name_here` with the name of the pre-trained model you wish to use.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```
python save_pretrained_zsl_model.py
```

### How it works

The script performs the following steps:

1. Imports the necessary libraries and modules, including `os`, `pickle`, and `pipeline` from `transformers`.
2. Defines the path to the data directory where the pickle file will be saved.
3. Initializes the zero-shot classification pipeline with the specified pre-trained model.
4. Saves the classifier object to a pickle file named `zslmodel.pkl` in the specified data directory.

By saving the pre-trained model to a pickle file, you can easily load and use the model in other scripts or applications without having to re-initialize the pipeline each time.
